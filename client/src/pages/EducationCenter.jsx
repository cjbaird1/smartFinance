        <p className="mb-2">
          In machine learning, a <strong>feature</strong> is a measurable property or characteristic of the data that the model uses to make predictions. Features can be as simple as a stock's closing price, or as complex as a technical indicator derived from multiple data points. The quality and relevance of features are key to building effective predictive models.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          A <strong>Feature Dictionary</strong> is a reference guide that explains each input variable (feature) used in a machine learning model. It helps users understand what data the model is using, why each feature matters, and how it's calculated. This transparency is crucial for both learning and trust in the model's predictions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The following 17 features are the current default set used in our app's machine learning model for stock prediction. They were chosen to capture a broad range of price action, momentum, trend, and volatility signals. As our platform evolves, we may add or customize features to further improve model performance.
