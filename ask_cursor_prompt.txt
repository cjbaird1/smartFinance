Okay for the requirements for this project. I am on this part: Section 2b: Stretch Requirements 
1. ML-Based Stock Movement Prediction (Bullish, Bearish, Neutral) 
● Success Measure: User inputs a ticker, and app returns a classification label 
(Neutral, Bullish, Bearish) 
● Demonstration: Verified by model output as well as visual display

How can we implement this into our trading-simulator page? What might be the easiest way?
